Welcome to the Star Fleet Telescope.  
The goal is to collect all the planets requested by Star Fleet for our future explorations.  
  
Check the glossary to learn the characteristics of planet classes.  
Use the filter buttons in the action bar to apply them to the telescope. Observe the characteristics to identify the planets.  
You can consult the color code in the filter tab.  
The zoom button adjusts the telescope's zoom, and the speed button changes the scanning speed.  
Center the view on a planet and use the camera button to take a photo and save the planet in your library.  
You can rename your planet when saving it.
